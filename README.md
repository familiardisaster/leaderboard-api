# Leaderboard API

REST API built in Flask for a website I helped create to manage a leaderboard system. Changed and excluded many things for privacy purposes. Simple framework easily adaptable for many other API use cases. 

An interesting experience learning more about how API's work, how to secure them (which I largley exlcuded in this demo), and why they are useful.
